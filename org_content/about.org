Hello, I am Peter Lo. I received my B.Sc. in [[http://www2.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/rms/][Risk Management Science]], and my Ph.D. in [[https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/en/][Computer Science and Engineering]], both from [[http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html][The Chinese University of Hong Kong]]. During my Ph.D. study, I worked in Bioinformatics, focusing on inferring gene regulatory network from gene expression data. After graduation, I worked as a Postdoc at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, where I worked on Chinese NLP.

I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, including Symbolic AI, Machine Learning and Natural Computing techniques. I also enjoy music at my leisure.

Now I work as a data scientist in the Hong Kong data science team of [[https://www.massmutual.com/about-us][MassMutual]], which is an insurance company based in the U.S. with a long history.
