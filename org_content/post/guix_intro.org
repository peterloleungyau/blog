This is a brief introduction to the Guix functional package manager,
and how it could be used to manage dependencies of projects, much like
virtual environments for Python, but with much larger scope.

This is written in a way that I wish Guix was introduced to me back
when I first learnt it.

# summary

* What is Guix?

** Guix: functional package manager
Guix has the following characteristics:
   - [[https://guix.gnu.org/][Guix]] is in fact a package building system, being a good package manager is a side effect
     - inspired by the [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]] functional package manager
       - which is in turn partly inspired by functional programming, and by [[https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Main_Page][Gentoo]]'s package management
     - to make the package building be a /pure function/ and therefore more easily reproduced
   - designed to properly address the "dependency hell" problem
   - aim at reproducible builds
     - the /exact/ same set of packages could be reproduced at a later time or on a different machine (of the same architecture), by just using two small text files
   - allows atomic installation/uninstallation/upgrade of packages
     - each action is a *transaction*, i.e. either it succeeds as a whole, or does not succeeds, there would not be half installed packages
   - allows easy rollback of install/uninstall actions
     - each transaction results in new generation
     - can easily rollback to previous generations
     - so there is little fear of accidentally installing/uninstalling/upgrading the wrong packages
   - allows different versions of the "same" package to coexist and used by different pakcages, without conflict
   - encourages declarative package management
     - a set of packages can be specified in a *manifest file*, and can be installed in one transaction
   - currently only works on GNU/Linux
     - can be installed on any GNU/Linux distribution such as Debian, Ubuntu, Arch, etc
     - can coexist with the existing package manager of the distribution
   - allows each user to manage his/her own packages
     - without root privilege
     - without interferring other users
   - each user can have multiple *profiles* of packages
     - each profile has its own list of generations, and can be rolled back separately
   - allows easy creation of isolated environments with designated packages
   - *Guix system* is a GNU/Linux distribution built on top of the Guix package manager
     - use a config file to declaratively specify the whole system, e.g. the system services, user accounts, etc


At this point, you may not think these characteristics are special if
you have not experienced the pains brought by dependency
management. Hopefully after reading this post you will have better
appreciation of why a package manager is useful and why Guix is a good
one due to these good characteristics.

** Basic concepts of packages and dependency
We first list out some concepts related to packages and dependency:
   - *package*:
     - loosely speakinig, a package is a collection of functionality that we are interested in, e.g.
       - a library of functions, e.g. the [[https://www.tidyverse.org/][tidyverse]] R package
       - some applications, e.g. the [[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/][firefox]] web browser
       - command line programs, e.g. the [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]] command for fast grep search on contents of files
       - or just a set of documentation files
   - *package building*:
     - the final files in a package are often produced through a /building/ process from some sort of /source/ files
     - e.g.
       - =ripgrep= is written in the [[https://www.rust-lang.org/][Rust programming language]], and would need a Rust compiler to produce the program
       - some pdf documentations may be produced through the [[https://www.latex-project.org/][Latex]] typesetting system
       - an R package needs to be built, see https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/RProgDA/building-r-packages.html
     - some packages are very flexible, and allow specifying different options when building, resulting in functionally slightly different packages
       - e.g. some functions may be left out if it is considered not useful
       - e.g. some function could be provided by different *dependent packages*
     - building script:
       - most packages have some building process (e.g. a script or a makefile)
     - building environment:
       - some packages will automatically detect its environment to change building options
       - e.g. if some other package is absent, some functionality will be left out, but the building will still succeed
       - therefore, if the building environment is not properly isolated, the "same" building script may still result in different built package, depending on what other packages are present in the system
       - this is similar to programming where the output of a "function" depends not only on its inputs, but also on other global variables
   - *package version*:
     - strictly speaking, package version is just a name attached to a package, and the name could theoretically be arbitrary, although most package authors follow some conventions
     - e.g. a lot of packages follow the [[https://semver.org/][Semantic versioning]], briefly
       - a version number consists of three numbers, in the format of "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH", e.g. "1.0.4", where each should be increment as follows
         - MAJOR: when you make incompatible API changes, where MINOR and PATCH could be reset to 0, e.g. from "1.2.3" to "2.0.0"
         - MINOR: when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, where PATCH could be reset to 0, e.g. from "1.2.3" to "1.3.0"
         - PATCH: when you make backwards compatible bug fixes, e.g. from "1.2.3" to "1.2.4"
     - NOTE:
       - normally, different versions will have some differences, although they may be small, or supposed to be /backward compatible/.
       - even for the same vesion number, the package may be functionally different if built differently, as mentioned above.
   - *dependency*:
     - loosely speaking, if a package A needs another package B to provide some functionality, then A /depends/ on B, i.e. B is a /dependency/ of A.
     - *direct/indirect dependency*:
       - often a package will list out its needed dependencies (possibly also the range of allowed versions of each dependency), either formally in some fixed format, or informally as free text in some readme
       - *direct dependency*: the dependencies listed for a package
       - *indirect dependency*: not direct dependency, but are (direct or indirect) dependencies of the direct dependencies
       - Why the distinction of direct and indirect dependency? Both are needed to fully capture the dependencies.
         - the distinction is useful mainly when the dependency updates
         - if package A directly depends on package B, presumably the developers of A knows which functionality of B is needed
         - if B is updated to B1, then the developers of A need only check whether the needed functionality is still provided by B1, and act accordinly, rather than checking each of the dependencies of B and B1 to see which are still needed.
     - *build-time/run-time dependency*:
       - *build-time dependency*: dependency needed for building a package
         - e.g. a particular version =gcc= for compiling a program
         - e,g, *statically linked libraries*, i.e. those compiled into the program, so are needed at build-time
         - a build-time dependency may or may not be needed when the program is later run
       - *run-time dependency*: dependency needed for using the package, e.g. running the application
         - e.g. the *dynamically linked libraries*, i.e. the libraries will be loaded only when the program is run
         - nowadays, most programs use mostly dynamically linked libraries
         - NOTE: a dependency can be both build-time and run-time dependency
     - *optional dependency*: dependency that can be omitted for the package to build or run, but some functionality may be missing
       - e.g. [[http://www.inkscape.org/][inkscape]] can be built without the optional dependency =potrace=, just without bitmap tracing functionality.
       - in most *package manager* which mainly distribute binary packages, often most optional dependencies would be included to provide the most funcitonality
   - *dependency hell*:
     - roughly speaking, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell][dependency hell]] refers to the problems caused by the dependency on specific versions of some packages.
     - dependency hell takes a few forms:
       - too many or long chains of dependencies:
         - this is only a problem if the dependencies have to be hunted down manually, which could become tedious very quickly
         - most package managers solve this by installing the dependencies when a package is installed
       - conflicting dependencies:
         - in many package manager (and default in dynamic library in Linux), minor versions are considered backward compatible, and for each package of the same major version, only the newest minor version is kept/used
         - if both package A and B depend on a package C, but A and B needs different minor versions of C to work correctly, then A and B have conflicts
         - this may happen if B is updated to B1 causing C to be updated to C1, therefore causing A to break, even if the older versions of the 3 packages previously coexisted and worked correctly.

           #+CAPTION: Dependency before updating B
           [[file:dep_before_update.png]]

           #+CAPTION: Dependency after updating B
           [[file:dep_after_update.png]]

         - in this case, it is clear that if we just let A to use the old C, and the new B1 to use the new C1, then A can work as before, and B can still be updated to B1.

           #+CAPTION: Ideal dependency after updating B
           [[file:dep_ideal_after_update.png]]

   - ways that code of package A can break if a dependency B updates to a supposingly /backward compatible/ minor version:
     - although most of the time updating a minor version does not cause problem, they might still cause breakage
     - e.g. suppose A depends on a function in B, there could be a few cases:
       - the function interface remains unchanged or adds optional parameters, but the implementation is changed:
         - A may rely on undocumented behavior of the function, which has changed in the new implementation, although the documented interface is still the same.
           - e.g. the old implementation may sort the output as a side effect, but not promised in the function interface, and A may have relied on the sorted order
         - the new implementation may have buggy edge case, causing A to break
         - the new implementation may expose a buggy edge case in A, causing A to break
   - *reproducible build*
     - it is desirable to have the /exact same versions/ of dependencies between testing and production systems, and preferably also for the development environment
     - it is therefore desirable to /reproduce/ the exact same set of packages on a different machine (of the same architecture) and/or at a different time
     - this could be achieved in two main ways:
       - record the set of versions of the (pre-built) packages, and reinstall when needed
         - e.g. python virtual environment mostly follow this paradigm
       - record the set of versions of the packages, and rebuild then when needed
         - this is similar to the previous one, with the difference that the package can be built from scratch if needed
         - e.g. Guix can rebuild package(s) through the set of package definitions with explicit dependencies information
           - Guix can simply download the pre-built package (called /substitute/ in Guix) when available
       - record the set of built packages and just copy them as a whole when needed
         - e.g. building a docker image to contain all needed packages
     - isolated building environment can help with reproduciblity
       - only the explicitly listed dependencies are visible in building, so that the building script will not depend on other packages unknowingly
   - reproducibility raises the question of /sameness/ of packages
     - the package name with version number /would be/ sufficient if each version if always built the same way with the same versions of dependencies
       - this is the strategy adopted by most package managers
     - a better way is to use the package name together with some kind of *hash*
       - not necessarily the hash /of/ the package itself, as we will see in later sections
       - but different contents of a package should produce different hashes
   - *hash*:
     - basically a (very large) integer calculated through a *hash function* on some input, e.g. a file
     - the calculated integer is in some fixed range, often written as a long hexadecimal string such as "730e109bd7a8a32b1cb9d9a09aa2325d2430587ddbc0c38bad911525"
     - the input however often has not length limit
     - e.g. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2][sha-256]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5][md5]]
     - desired properties of a good *hash function*:
       - the same input always produce the same hash, i.e. it is a /pure function/ in the mathematical sense
         - i.e. if two inputs produce different hashes, they /must be/ different
       - it is one-way
         - there is not efficient way to recover the original content just from the hash, other than trying all possible input to find those that give the same hash
       - even a slight change in the input causes drastically different hash
         - useful for identifying corruption or tampering of files
       - /low/ collision, i.e. different inputs /should/ produce different hashes
         - it is impossible to have /no/ collision unless the set of possible inputs is less than the set of possible outputs
     - note that one hash is enough to represent a web of connected things:
       - e.g.
         - if you have a few (ordered) inputs, you hash each of them, and write the hashes to a file, then you hash this file
         - this is still a deterministic hashing process
         - if any of the input is changed, its calculated hash will /most probably/ be different, so this file of hashes will be different, and consequently the final hash will be different
         - each of the input itself could contain hashes of more inputs recursively, so a web of things could be represented as one hash
         - this technique is also used in [[https://git-scm.com/][git]] version control system to link the commits together
         - the same technique could be used to hash the (direct) dependencies of a package, and therefore one hash could represent all the direct and indirect dependencies of a package

* A closer look at Guix
** Overview of the different parts of Guix
   We introduce the main parts of guix through a hypothetical Q&A, so
   that the parts are better motivated, and it is clearer how each
   parts fits into the whole.

TODO: add a diagram for overview of parts of Guix

   - Q: We are making a package manager to help us manage
     dependencies, where should we start?
     - A: Eventually a package needs to be built, we may as well make
       a package building tool which also manages dependencies.
   - Q: Each package has some way of building, e.g. the usual
     configure-make or cmake for most C or C++ projects, Python
     packages have their usual way of building, R package can be built
     by =R CMD build=, so we can have commands for each type of build
     systems to reduce repetitive work, so that for each package we
     only specify the unique parts and we should be done?
     - A:It is a good idea to have commands for different build
       systems, so we can have =gnu-build-system= (for configure-make
       builds), =cmake-build-system=, =python-build-system=,
       =r-build-system=, =julia-build-system=, =texlive-build-system=,
       =emacs-build-system=, =maven-build-system=,
       =linux-module-build-system=, =node-build-system= and others.
     - A: But packages often have dependencies (which is the whole
       point of package manager), so we should also specify the
       dependencies of each package, separately for build-time and
       run-time dependencies. It is also nice to have a /package
       definition/ to specify these in a sort of declarative way. We
       may also add some metadata to the package definition such as
       package name, version number, a short description.
     - A: An example of package definition is:
       #+begin_src scheme
         (define-public r-jsonlite
           (package
             (name "r-jsonlite")
             (version "1.7.2")
             (source (origin
                       (method url-fetch)
                       (uri (cran-uri "jsonlite" version))
                       (sha256
                        (base32
                         "1lhzcpz9clwq04i5m6jzkvw9x03pwlqrixv4l9xzchjr8d84nd86"))))
             (build-system r-build-system)
             (native-inputs
              `(("r-knitr" ,r-knitr)))
             (home-page "https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2805")
             (synopsis "Robust, high performance JSON parser and generator for R")
             (description
              "The jsonlite package provides a fast JSON parser and generator optimized
         for statistical data and the web.  It offers flexible, robust, high
         performance tools for working with JSON in R and is particularly powerful for
         building pipelines and interacting with a web API.  In addition to converting
         JSON data from/to R objects, jsonlite contains functions to stream, validate,
         and prettify JSON data.  The unit tests included with the package verify that
         all edge cases are encoded and decoded consistently for use with dynamic data
         in systems and applications.")
             (license license:expat)))
       #+end_src
   - Q: So with the metadata, we can first ensure the dependencies are
     available and build them if necessary, before building our target
     package. But how to prevent incorrectly specified dependencies?
     - A: To avoid unspecified dependencies, the package can be built
       in an isolated environment (e.g. a chroot environment) where
       only the explicitly specified dependencies are available, so
       that if a needed dependency is not specified, the package will
       not build successfully, so that we will be aware of the problem
       at package development time.
     - A: Overly specified dependencies is less of a problem, because
       the target package can still be built if there are extra
       packages available. So one way is to ignore this problem, and
       simply let package definition writer add dependencies as needed
       while testing the build.
   - Q: How to name the package in a unique way? Can we use the
     package name and the version number, e.g. =r-jsonlite-1.7.2=?
     - A: Even for the same version of a package, the building
       parameters (e.g. compiler options) or available dependencies
       (e.g. optional dependencies, some of which can be turned on or
       off when building) can still result in different package
       artefact. If we always use a canonical building parameters and
       options, then using only the name and version would
       suffice. But it would be good to have a much finer-grained
       identify for each exact version of each package, and it can be
       used for other purposes such as caching.
     - A: We can pre-pend some kind of hash calculated from the inputs (or
       their hashes) to the build process, including:
       - source
       - dependencies
       - build system and parameters such as compiler options
       - environment variables to be defined
       - target system type
       - where to store the built package
     - A: The hash transitively encodes the exact versions of package
       and all its direct and indirect dependencies.
     - A: an example of such a unique name is
       =2am1s5hqgkzxzbyvcfbhxq72diny117q-r-yaml-2.2.1=
   - Q: Maybe we just calculate the hash of the built artefacts? Oh,
     but then we will always need to build the package in order to
     calculate the hash, which greatly reduces the usefulness of the
     hash?
     - A: Instead of calculating the hash of the final built artefact,
       we can produce a /derivation/ which has sufficient details to
       exactly *reproduce* the package when built. The derivation can be
       produced efficiently, without building the package. As long as
       the build process is *deterministic*, the hash of the derivation
       is as good as the hash of the final built artefacts in uniquely
       identifying the exact version of the package.
     - A: an example of derivation is (note that it is in a canonical
       way without unnecessary whitespace):

       #+end_src
   - Q: by "reproduce" do you mean building the bit-by-bit identical artefacts?
     - A: Yes, Guix aims at bit-by-bit reproduciblity. Since we are
       controlling also the build dependencies (e.g. the exact
       compiler version) and building parameters, for a given
       architecture (e.g. x86_64), it ought to be able to build the
       exact same artefacts at a different time, possibly on a
       different machine with the same architecture.
     - A: Reproducibility helps with testing, because once a package
       has been tested in an environment, we have high confidence that
       it will behave the same in the same environment, even if it was
       built at a later time.
     - A: But this strict reproducibility depends on having a
       deterministic build process using the derivation. So the build
       cannot for example involve randomness, or write current
       timestamp in any of the build artefact. So for some packages
       the build system may need to adjusted for remove these. Guix
       provides hooks to specify in the package definition any
       adjustments of the different building phases of any build
       system.
   - Q: From the above example of package definition, the dependency
     specifies only the package name but not the exact version?
     - A: Yes, when the dependency only lists the name of the package,
       the exact version is implicit, i.e. it is whatever the version
       that is built together with the target package.
     - A: Most package managers have a ability to specify version
       ranges for dependencies, and a constraint solver is needed to
       determine whether a certain set of packages have conflicts. But
       to my knowledge this is not available in Guix. In Guix, it is
       assumed that when a package definition is developed, it is
       tested against a particular version of package definitions as
       dependencies. If none of the package definition of direct or
       indirect dependency is changed, the package can be exactly
       reproduced. If any of the depdency was later changed, depending
       on how many packages it may affect, different levels of testing
       would be performed to minimize the adverse effect of breaking
       other packages.
   - Q: The set of package definitions is critical, how to manage them in a sane way?
     - A: The package definitions can be organized as a set of files,
       each containing a set of related packages (e.g. one file for R
       CRAN packages, one file for Python PyPi packages, etc). In Guix
       these files are in fact code, so it is a good idea to manage
       them with source control system such as git.
     - A: In Guix, a repository of package definitions is maintained
       as a git repository, the official one is
       https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git
     - A: Another benefit of maintaining package definitions in git
       repository is that a git commit represents a snapshot of all
       the package definitions at a time point, which allows easy
       pinning of package versions of a set of packages.
   - Q: Can I maintain my private list of packages?
     - A: Guix allows using multiple channels at the same time, and
       creating a channel is basically as simple as creating a git
       repository. So you can easily create your own channel(s) as a
       (public or private) git repository, for whatever package
       definitions that you want to maintain, as long as the computer
       where Guix is installed can access the repository. Moreoever,
       you can also add third-party channels (similar to PPA in Debian
       based distribution) for extra packages.
     - A: The channels of Guix is recorded at a text file, including
       the current commit of each channel. This file facilitates
       version controlling the states of the channels.
     - A: An example of a file with two channels is:
       #+begin_src scheme
         (list (channel
                 (name 'nonguix)

TODO

* Why bother with Guix? There are other ways to handle dependency
Although there are a lot of package managers at both the language level and operating system level, and tools such as docker to help tackle the dependency problem, Guix still has merits when compared to these, as we now discuss.

** Use opearting system package managers
  - e.g. apt, yum, pacman
  - these package managers resolve dependencies for you, some allows pinning particular versions of package
  - sometimes language specific packages is also packaged
  - downsides:
    - these package managers mostly operate by /mutating/ the system state when adding or removing packages, so may not be easy to revert to previous state in case installing/upgrading some packages causes problem
      - if the process is interrupted, the system might be in an inconsistent state
      - installing/upgrading package may cause some dependencies to be updated, which might break other packages
      - subsequently removing that package does not necessarily revert the updated dependencies
    - since installing/upgrading package may cause dependencies to be updated, which may cause conflicts if some packages need older versions of the dependencies
      - although this is not common, this could be painful when happens
      - this is problematic often when you want newer version of some package, but older version of another package, and they (or their chain of dependencies) somehow have version conflicts
    - since the packages are installed to some shared location, usually root privilege is needed to install/upgrade/remove packages, e.g. through =sudo=
      - this is not much of a problem on desktop Linux system because it is often used by one person
      - it is more of a problem on servers with multiple users, either we trust all users and give them root privilege (through =sudo=), or we reserve the root privilege to a small number of users (e.g. the system admins)
      - and the possibility of possible breakage and conflict when upgrading packages only increases with the number of users
      - therefore, on such systems, some users may not get the packages he/she wants, either it is too new or too old, because the updating schedule is often set by the system admins
      - package managers such as [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]] try to remedy this short-coming by installing packages under the user's home directory, and therefore each user can manage his/her own packages without root privilege
        - although this reduces possible conflicts with other users, there are still possible conflicts among the packages
  - upsides of Guix:
    - Guix can be used just like the usual system package manager, although there are better ways of using it for specific needs
    - every install/remove/upgrade packages action (which may involve multiple packages) is one /transaction/, and causes a /generation/ to be created
      - Guix can detect and remedy interrupt of the action to maintain transactional behavior, i.e. either it succeeds or fails as a whole, so that the system would not be in a half-completed inconsistent state.
        - if an action is interrupted, it has not succeeded, and can be safely repeated
        - but in case an action involves multiple packages, a completely downloaded or built package need not be re-built or re-downloaded when the action is repeated, since they would be cached (in a /store/ where only the Guix daemon can modify) and identified by hash.
      - a /generation/ is essentially a record of the set of specific packages and their dependencies, so it is easy to revert to previous generation
        - all the packages and dependencies referenced by a generation would be kept in the system
        - so normally removing packages in Guix simply results in a generation without those packages, the packages themselves are still in the system cache, this is similar in spirit to git where a commit "deletes" some files.
        - reverting to other generation involves only updating some symbolic links, so are quick
        - the user safely try out different versions of some packages, knowing that it is easy to revert to previous known good state if the user dislike the version for whatever reason (e.g. bugs, different UI, missing features, etc)
        - the user can optionally delete older generations, and do a /garbage collection/ to really delete any unreferenced (directly or indirectly) packages to free up disk space
    - each package in Guix literally has its dependencies hard-coded using absolute paths to the dependeny in the /store/
      - each package in Guix is cached in a /store/ with a path with some sort of hash to identify the exact version of the package
      - therefore an updated package may also have updated dependencies, but older versions of the package or other packages still refer to their previous versions of dependencies fixed at built time
      - therefore there is no fear that updating a package will break another package just because they share some dependencies with conflicting versions
      - also, two packages with conflicting dependencies can coexist in Guix because each can have their own versions of dependencies
    - Guix allows each user to manage his/her own packages without root privilege
      - the /store/ of installed packages in Guix is managed by a dedicated daemon, so are essentially read-only to the users, so identical packages can be safely shared
      - each user has his/her symbolic links under the home directory to profiles containing sets of packages, so any install/upgrade/remove actions can be performed by the user without root privilege
      - and as mentioned above, because of hard-coded dependencies for each package, there will not be package conflicts among users nor for the same user
** Use language specific package manager such as pip, packrat, npm, etc
  - many programming languages have their own package manager, because the system package manager may not have these language-specific packages, and having a language specific one would be more uniform across different operating systems or Linux distributions
  - e.g.
    - pip for Python
    - =install.packages()= for R
    - npm for Javascript
    - RubyGems for Ruby
    - Cabal for Haskell
  - for better management of possibly difference packages for different projects, there are either some sort of /virtual environment/, or some kind of /lock files/ to pin-point the versions of set of packages for each project, e.g.
    - [[https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#simple-python-version-management-pyenv][pyenv]], [[https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/][virtualenv]], [[https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/packages/pkg-docs/][anaconda]] for Python, see [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/39928067]] for a brief comparison
    - [[https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/][packrat]] or [[https://rstudio.github.io/renv/][renv]] for R
    - rubygems, npm and cabal have lock files
  - downsides:
    - these language-specific package managers naturally only handles packages for on programming language
      - if a project uses only one programming language, e.g. Python, then either one of the virtual environment manger may be sufficient
      - but if the projects in the same team use multiple programming languages, e.g. both Python and R for data science projects, then the users would need to be familiar with multiple package managers
    - these package managers may not help with system-level dependencies, especially when pre-built binary package is not available (e.g. R packages under Linux) and the package needs to be built
    - some dependencies are not managed by these virtual environments
      - e.g. packrat, being an R library, does not help manage the version of R itself
        - although this is often ok because R is usually backward compatible, but sometimes there could be issues, e.g. see https://github.com/rstudio/packrat/issues/327
      - in contrast, virutal environments in Python can also manage different versions of Python, because there are bigger differences between versions of Python
    - the virtual environments are often setup per-project, but identical packages (and dependencies) may be duplicated instead of shared, taking up more disk space than necessary (unless the filesystem had built-in support for deduplication)
      - e.g. packrat for R install a copy of the needed packages for each project
      - in contrast, renv for R has a global shared cache of packages, so that identical packages can be shared for different projects, see https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/renv/vignettes/renv.html
  - upsides of Guix:
    - Guix has system-level libraries, applications, language specific pakcages all at the same level, and can be managed in the same way.
      - e.g. =r-tidyverse= is the Guix package for the R [[https://www.tidyverse.org/][tidyverse]] package, which depends on many other R packages, all of can also be managed by Guix
      - e.g. =python-numpy= is the Guix package for the Python [[https://numpy.org/][numpy]] package, which depends on =gfortran@7.5.0= (version 7.5.0), =lapack@3.9.0=, =openblas@0.3.9=, =python-cython@0.29.21= and =python-pytest@5.3.5=
      - e.g. =r-xml= is the Guix package for the R [[https://cran.microsoft.com/web/packages/XML/index.html][xml]] package, which (as of this writing, at version 3.99-0.5) depends on libxml2@2.9.10, pkg-config@0.29.2 and zlib@1.2.11, but these libraries are managed by Guix in the same way as any other dependencies
      - the philosophy of Guix is really to manage as many dependencies as sensible, e.g. =emacs-projectile= is the Guix package for the [[https://docs.projectile.mx/projectile/index.html][projectile]] package of the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] text editor
      - Guix can also mange R itself as a package, so the R version can also be managed just as any other packages in your project
      - therefore, Guix can handle dependencies across multiple programming language, and mixing with system level dependencies
    - all Guix packages are put in =/gnu/store=, with a path having the name and a hash, e.g. =/gnu/store/9naz5xl42amla3ph860yxxqrk9420nvr-r-tidyverse-1.3.0= for the =r-tidyverse= currently on my system
      - this store is only modifiable by the Guix daemon, and are read-only for normal users
      - by virtue of the nice properties of the hash, this path serves as a unique identity of package, even if they have the same version number
        - e.g. currently on my system, I find three Python 3.8.2 packages with different hashes, which are probably dependencies of other packages, and are built with slightly different settings:
          - =/gnu/store/09a5iq080g9b641jyl363dr5jkkvnhcn-python-3.8.2=
          - =/gnu/store/jxx8fr78jrcvpid5aplmkplbm1dk6czs-python-3.8.2=
          - =/gnu/store/q9rm8h9imazsq2c4qiv2yjpvlvliywqb-python-3.8.2=
      - therefore, the exact same package (as identified using the path) can be shared, while different versions (even with the same version number) can coexist
      - also, when installing packages, if the exact package is also in the store, it need not be downloaded/built again
    - Guix can manage per-project dependencies, similar to a virtual environment or a per-project lockfile
      - a list of packages can be recorded in an /manifest/ file, which is a plain text file that can be easily version-controlled
      - e.g. an manifest file for some R packages may look like this (this is in fact [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)][Scheme]] code, because Guix is implemented as a /domain specific language/ in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/][Guile]] implementation of Scheme):
        #+begin_src scheme
          (specifications->manifest
            '(
              ;; R
              "r"
              "r-yaml"
              "r-xgboost"
              "r-tidymodels"
              "r-tidyverse"
              "r-survminer"
              ))
        #+end_src
      - the manifest file is declarative, and simple enough that it can be easily maintained even by manually editing as needed
      - note that the manifest file only contains the names of the packages, but not the explicit versions
        - so by itself, it cannot pin-point the exact versions of the packages (and their dependencies)
        - each (specific version) of package is described by a package definition
          - e.g. the package definition for =r-xgboost= (version 1.2.0.1) is:
            #+begin_src scheme
              (define-public r-xgboost
                (package
                  (name "r-xgboost")
                  (version "1.2.0.1")
                  (source
                   (origin
                     (method url-fetch)
                     (uri (cran-uri "xgboost" version))
                     (sha256
                      (base32

            - other auxiliary information which are not really essential, but nice to have
          - the set of all these package definitions is managed with git repository
            - they are managed as /channel/, which is git repository with some meta-data
            - there is an official repository at https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git
            - user can create their own repository for their own modification or private packages that they would not like to share with outsiders
            - the particular commit(s) of the channel(s) in your system /determine/ which exact versions of the packages when installed, reproducibly
          - the current commit(s) of channel(s) can be exported to a plain text file by Guix, e.g.

                      (name 'guix)

            #+end_src
          - Guix also provides /time-machine/ to conveniently use particular commit(s) of channel(s) (in the form as exported above) for any Guix actions, see [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#Invoking-guix-time_002dmachine][Invoking guix time-machine]]
          - therefore, by keeping two easily version-controlled plain text files (the manifest file for packages and the exported channel description), a set of particular versions of packages can be recorded reproducibly
      - there are a few ways to use the manifest file (and can be used together with channel description through time-machine for maximum benefits), in fact a manifest file is only a convenient way to specify a list of packages, so can be used for different commands of Guix:
        - install the specified packages in one transaction (on the default profile of the user):
          - this is inconvenient for managing different sets of packages for different projects, because the actions are applied to the default profile of the user
          - there are better ways for managing per-project packages
        - a better way is to install the specified packages in a separate profile for the project:
          - each user can create multiple profiles in addition to the default one, and each profile can has a separate set of packages and its own sequence of generations
          - each profile can be activated as needed, much like a virtual environment in Python
          - the Guix install/upgrade/remove actions can be applied to specified profile, see the =-p= option of [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#Invoking-guix-package][Invoking-guix-package]] for details
          - but the downside is that when the set of packages in the manifest file is changed, the user need to remember to reapply the manifest file to the chosen profile to update the set of packages
          - if the packages for each project are rarely changed, using profiles can be a reasonable way of managing per-projet packages, but there is still a better way
        - spawns a new shell with the specified packages accessible in the =PATH=, by using =guix environment=:
          - =guix environment= is a powerful and flexible command in Guix
            - we can choose to have the packages themselves be accessible in the shell, by placing the list of packages or using the =-m= option for manifest file after the =--ad-hoc= option
            - or we can choose to have the direct dependencies of the packages be accessible, or both
              - having the dependencies be accessible is useful for developing a package, because we may need the dependencies for test building the package and tweak as neede
            - we can either have an interactive shell with the needed packages accessible,
            - or we can directly execute a command in the new shell by placing the command (and the arguments) after a =--= at the end of the list of packages
            - can choose to have only the specified packages be accessible in the new shell by using the =--pure= option, the default is to augment current =PATH=
            - can even choose to run the command inside an isolated container, which uses the isolation capability of the Linux kernel in a similar way to docker containers
            - of course this can be combined with guix time-machine
            - =guix environment= is basically creating a temporary profile, so would not "pollute" or clutter the default profile when the shell exits or the specified command ends
            - the specified packages will be downloaded/built if they are not already in the cache
            - see [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#Invoking-guix-environment][Invoking-guix-environment]] for more details of other useful options
          - therefore, we can spawn a new shell with needed packages each time we work on a project, we won't forget to reapply the manifest file
          - e.g. to work on a project, suppose in a R project directory
            - there is a manifest file =pkgs.scm= specifying the packages (including R itself),
            - and there is an exported channel description file =channels.scm= containing the commits of the channels
            - when we want to work on the project, we can type in the shell
              #+begin_src shell
                guix time-machine -C channels.scm -- environment --ad-hoc -m pkgs.scm
                # then in the new shell, start R
                R
              #+end_src
            - or you can do it in one line:
              #+begin_src shell
                guix time-machine -C channels.scm -- environment --ad-hoc -m pkgs.scm -- R
              #+end_src
            - the first time running this may take a while if the packages are not yet downloaded/built in your system, but subsequent runs should be much quicker because the packages are already cached
            - moreover, these =pkgs.scm= and =channels.scm= files can be committed to version control system (e.g. git) together with other project files
              - they are project dependencies, which are logically part of the project, so in my opinion should also be committed
              - then everyone working on the project would be using the same versions of packages for the same commit
              - if these two files are changed, the correct versions of the needed packages would be prepared by Guix the next time you work on the project
            - of course, typing this long line each time is tiresome, so we can make an alias in your shell (e.g. by adding this to your =.bashrc= or =.bash_profile=) to reduce some typing, e.g.
              #+begin_src shell
                alias work="guix time-machine -C channels.scm -- environment --ad-hoc -m pkgs.scm"
              #+end_src
              then you can just type
              #+begin_src shell
                work -- R
              #+end_src
            - working with Python project, or any other language is similar, just make sure you have the needed packages in the =pkgs.scm= file.
            - one thing that I have not yet investigated deeply enough:
              - of course, we usually use some development tools such as IDE or text editor that are usually personal preferences, so they should not be put into =pkgs.scm=, but should better be installed in the default user profile
              - e.g. for R, common choices are [[https://rstudio.com/][RStudio]], [[https://ess.r-project.org/][Emacs ESS]] with [[https://ess.r-project.org/][ESS]], [[https://www.vim.org/][Vim]], [[https://code.visualstudio.com/][VSCode]]
              - you would need some way to make these tools see and use the R in the newly spawned shell, which may need some tweaking, but I have not yet spent the time to investigate this
          - e.g. another use is in running batch jobs, e.g. a [[https://www.jenkins.io/][Jenkins]] job:
            - suppose we have the same =pkgs.scm= and =channels.scm= in the project root
            - also suppose we want to batch run the R script =myscript.R=
            - assuming we have the same alias as above, we can run as (or config the Jenkins job to run this)
              #+begin_src shell
                work -- Rscript myscript.R
              #+end_src
            - of course you can run any command by putting them after =--=, and they would be run in the newly spawned shell
            - e.g. to run another shell script containing many commands
              #+begin_src shell
                work -- sh myscript.sh
              #+end_src
            - again, using Guix ensures that the correct versions of the needed packages are there when needed, this is especially convenient when you need to run code on multiple machines, e.g. on multiple Jenkins nodes, and saves you the trouble of manually managing the dependencies on multiple machines for multiple projects.
          - it should be clear that Guix can provide at least the same virtual environment like functionality, if not more useful and convenient
** Avoid dependency hell by including all dependencies
  - including all depedencies is also a valid way to avoid dependency hell
  - this has been common practice in Windows or MacOS for many years
  - in Linux, smilar strategy has become more common in recent years, e.g (among others).
    - [[https://flatpak.org/][flatpak]] provides bundled dependencies and sandboxing. This is mainly for application distribution
    - [[https://appimage.org/][AppImage]] aims at providing a universal format for application that can run in different Linux distributions, with dependencies included. This is mainly for application distribution
    - [[https://www.docker.com/][docker]] provided bundled dependencies in an /docker image/, and can run programs in an isolated (optionally for network and filesystem access) /container/. This is commonly used for deployment and preparing a consistent development environment.
      - docker images are often built using a /dockerfile/ which is a text file with imperative directives
      - docker images are often built on top of another base image which already has included a lot of needed parts, so that by choosing (or first building) a suitable base image, images can often be built with a relatively simple dockerfile.
      - once a docker image is built, the same running environment can be easily reproduced by starting another container using the same image
      - docker images are organized in layers, where identical layers can be shared between images
        - roughly, each directive in the dockerfile creates a layer
  - I will focus more on docker, as I do not have much experience with either flatpak or AppImage, but I think the comments apply similarly.
  - downsides:
    - although once the package or docker image is built, the user should have little trouble with dependencies, these tools do not provide much help with building the package or docker image
    - in order to /build/ a docker image /reproducibly/ through dockerfile, great care must be exercised:
      - a dockerfile often starts from a base image (e.g. from [[https://hub.docker.com/][docker hub]]) by a name and a tag, but the image itself may have been updated inbetween builds
        - if the base image is something like =ubuntu:latest= which is meant to be the most updated version, it is normal that different builds using the same dockerfile would see different base image
      - most dockerfiles would then update the package manager repository of the base image, e.g. =apt-get update= for Debian based distributions
        - this is usually done to get security updates of the packages
        - therefore, at different times, the exact versions of the packages may be different
      - then it is usual to install some package through the distribution package manager of the base image, or some language specific package manager
        - if the package versions are not carefully pinned, different versions may get installed at different times
      - if some packages are built from git repository, then a particular commit need to be used, otherwise, the latest version at the time of the build will be used
      - basically, dockerfile itself does not provide much help for reproducible build, it is up to the writer of the dockerfile to ensure as much reproducibility as possible
    - since the layers are organized linearly, the potential sharing is limited unless the dockerfiles of the different images are carefully organized to have as much in common as possible from the top
    - if some packages are built in building the docker image, some files or packages that are only needed in build time may be left over in the final image, if not carefully removed, making the image larger than necessary
      - see for example [[https://pythonspeed.com/articles/smaller-python-docker-images/][Multi-stage builds \#1: Smaller images for compiled code]] and [[https://medium.com/the-artificial-impostor/smaller-docker-image-using-multi-stage-build-cb462e349968][Smaller Docker Image using Multi-Stage Build]] for using multi-stage build to reduce docker image size
    - of course, sometimes the intention is simply to build the latest version of some packages, without reproducibility requirements, then dockerfiles is sufficient
  - upsides of Guix:
    - strong reproducibility guarantee
      - package definition contains the hash of source file for package building
      - isolated environment is used for package building, to make the build process as deterministic as possible
      - therefore need only use the same channel description file and Guix time machine to get the exact set of package definitions
      - together with a manifest file of desired packages, the desired set of packages and their dependencies can be exactly reproduced easily
    - Guix can be used to produce docker image
      - Guix can pack a set of packages and their dependencies (and nothing more, e.g. no leftover files only for building some packages) into various different formats, e.g. docker image, tarball and squashfs image, see the =-f= option in [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#Invoking-guix-pack][Invoking guix pack]] for details
        - Guix can also build a vm-image, disk-image or docker image through =guix system vm-image=, =guix system disk-image= or =guix system docker-image= respectively, see [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Invoking-guix-system.html#Invoking-guix-system][Invoking guix system]] for details
      - of course, this can be combined with Guix time machine through a channel file, and to use manifest files for the set of packages wanted
      - therefore, we can use Guix to produce docker image instead of using dockerfile to enjoy better reproduciblity, and continue to use the surrounding infrastructure built around docker images, e.g. [[https://kubernetes.io/][Kubernetes]]
      - therefore, Guix can be used in a complementary way to docker, if you do not wish to completely replace docker with Guix
    - Guix also allow running programs in container:
      - by using the isolation capability of the Linux kernel, Guix environment allows running programs in container basically in the same way as docker
      - the user can also control the sharing of current working directory and the network
      - see the =--container= or =-C= option and other related options in [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#Invoking-guix-environment][Invoking guix environment]] for details, but note that it requires a Linux kernel at least as new as version 3.19
    - more fine grained sharing
      - in Guix, each exact version of each package is identified by a hash (together with package name and version number), and identical packages are cached in the store and easily shared, either directly needed, or indirectly needed as a dependency of another package
      - this sharing is automatic, so does not need careful arrangement of the user, and much more fine-grained than simple layer sharing in docker image
      - there has been discussion among Guix developers to extend the sharing to individual files, so that identical files in different packages can also be shared

** Use another functional package manager such as Nix
   - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nix_package_manager][Nix]] origingated from Dolstra, E.'s PhD research [[https://nixos.org/~eelco/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf][The Purely Functional Software Deployment Model]], and refers to two related things:
     - Nix is a dynamically typed, functional programming language with lazy evaluation, designed for implemented the Nix functional package manager
     - Nix is a functional package manager implemented using the Nix programming language
       - Nix can be used on Linux and MacOS
       - Guix is inspired by Nix
       - basically Guix is a reimplementation of the Nix package manager using Guile instead of the Nix programming lanuage, and in the process can correct some crufts and add some improvements
   - [[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]] is a Linux distribution based on the Nix package manager, in the same way that Guix system is a Linux distribution based on the Guix package manager
   - Nix is also a fine choice of functional package manager
   - upsides of Nix / downsides of Guix:
     - while Guix is only available in Linux, Nix is available in both Linux and MacOS. However, the supporting and testing of packages in MacOS may not be as good as in Linux
     - since Nix was developed (first around 2004) much earlier than Guix (first release in 2013, see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Guix#Releases][GNU Guix Releases]]), Nix has more packages
   - downsides of Nix / upsides of Guix:
     - the Nix package manager is implemented in the Nix programming language, which is a very specialized and niche programming language because it is not used in other contexts or purposes
       - on the other hand, Guix is implemented in Guile, which is a dialect of Scheme. Scheme is a general purpose programming language useful in other contexts
       - of course, for simple use, the user of Nix need not know much about the underlying implementation language, just as Guix user need not know Guile to simple uses
       - but for more complicated uses, some knowledge of Nix (respectively Guile in the case of Guix) is needed, in which case learning a general purpose language may be considered more useful than learning a niche language, and the tools normally used for Scheme (e.g. editor support, REPL, debuggers) can be used for Guix hacking
       - also, the data structures available in the Nix language is more limited, whereas Guix can use distinct data structures for different kinds of objects
         - e.g. in Nix, each package is represented as a /function/ that takes inputs from a large mapping; but in Guix a package is represented as a first-class object in Scheme, forming an explicit dependency graphs, which easily allows different kinds of processing on the dependencies (e.g. substitute a particular package with a modified one; or plotting the dependency graph for visualization)
     - Guix was developed much later than Nix, and therefore has a chance to improve on some early decisions of Nix after the years of real world usage experience
       - e.g. the use of richer Scheme data structures in Guix for different kinds of objects
       - e.g. the rough equivalent to =guix environment= in Nix is [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Development_environment_with_nix-shell][nix-shell]], which is originally intended to provide a shell where the build-time dependencies of a package is available for development and testing
         - if you want to have some packages avaiable in the new shell, you can define a dummy package with the desired packages as build-time dependencies
         - in contrast, =guix environment= allows specifying the list packages of which their dependencies are wanted, or the list of packages which themselves are wanted (the =--ad-hoc= option), or a mixture of the two
           - apparently =nix-shell= now also allows this: https://nixos.org/manual/nix/unstable/command-ref/nix-shell.html
         - also, to my knowledge =nix-shell= does not have the convenient time machien as =guix time-machine= to pinpoint the set of packages at particular commit of channels, but similar effect could be achieved by some Nix constructs in the =shell.nix= or =default.nix= file manually
           - see [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/FAQ/Pinning_Nixpkgs][Pinning Nixpkgs]] for examples of pinning versions of packages
     - Nix relies more heavily on the shell for various build steps and occasionally causes trouble due to the escaping and substitutions in the shell, while Guix relies mostly on Scheme, so does not have issues with escaping
   - see the following for more comparison between Nix and Guix:
     - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16490027
     - https://sandervanderburg.blogspot.com/2012/11/on-nix-and-gnu-guix.html
     - https://www.reddit.com/r/GUIX/comments/hxcq7d/guix_vs_nix/
   - in short, both Nix and Guix are fine choices of functional package manager, and share a lot of similarities

* Try out Guix
** Get Guix
Refer to [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#System-Installation][System Installation]] for details on getting guix running
(either the guix system, or just the guix package manager), we brifely
summarize the main ways below. At the time of writing, the guix
version is 1.2.0.

*** Run guix system in qemu virtual machine with pre-made image
Running guix in a virtual machine is probably the easiest way to
try it out. [[https://www.qemu.org/][Qemu]] is a generic and open source emulator and virtualizer
that can be used to run a pre-made image.

Refer to [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#Running-Guix-in-a-VM][Running Guix in a Virtual Machine]] for more details. At the
time of writing, the guix version of the image is 1.2.0 for x86_64
architecture. We summarize the steps below:
  - install qemu following the instructions at [[https://www.qemu.org/download/][https://www.qemu.org/download/]]
  - download the [[https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/guix/guix-system-vm-image-1.2.0.x86_64-linux.xz][guix-system-vm-image-1.2.0.x86_64-linux.xz]] compressed image
  - decompress to get =guix-system-vm-image-1.2.0.x86_64-linux=
    #+begin_src shell
      xz -d guix-system-vm-image-1.2.0.x86_64-linux.xz
    #+end_src
  - invoke qemu on the image with
    #+begin_src shell
      qemu-system-x86_64 \
         -nic user,model=virtio-net-pci \
         -enable-kvm -m 1024 \
         -device virtio-blk,drive=myhd \
         -drive if=none,file=./guix-system-vm-image-1.2.0.x86_64-linux,id=myhd
    #+end_src
  - you can change arguments such as =-m= as appropriate to set the
    amount of memory desired. Note that you may need to tweak the
    arguments of invoking qemu a bit, depending on you host system.
    E.g. in macOS Mojave 10.14.6, I need to use the following:
    #+begin_src shell
      qemu-system-x86_64 \
         -nic user,model=virtio-net-pci \
         -m 1024 \
         -device virtio-blk,drive=myhd \
         -drive if=none,file=./guix-system-vm-image-1.2.0.x86_64-linux,id=myhd \
         -accel hvf
    #+end_src
  - wait for a while, then you will be in the default xfce desktop of
    a guix system, i.e. a GNU/Linux distribution built around
    guix. But note that by default, not many packages are installed,
    e.g. even a web browser is not installed by default. You may
    install them as needed, e.g. you may install =icecat= (the GNU
    version of Firefox browser) by:
    #+begin_src shell
      guix package -i icecat
    #+end_src
  - optional: since the command for invoking qemu can be very long,
    you may put it into a shell script to more conveniently invoke the
    vm
  - optional: you may use other front-ends (some are GUI) to more
    conveniently manage qemu vm, see
    https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Libvirt#Client

*** Install the guix system, the GNU/Linux distribution built on the Guix package manager
You can also install a guix system in either a virtual or physical machine.

**** Get the guix system install ISO image
Refer to [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#USB-Stick-and-DVD-Installation][USB Stick and DVD Installation]]
  - download the compressed 64-bit ISO from https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/guix/guix-system-install-1.2.0.x86_64-linux.iso.xz
    - you may instead get the compressed 32-bit ISO from https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/guix/guix-system-install-1.2.0.i686-linux.iso.xz
  - optionally verify the authenticity of the image:
    - get the sig file for 64-bit ISO and verify (change =x86_64-linux= to =i686-linux= if you download the 32-bit ISO)
      #+begin_src shell
        wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/guix/guix-system-install-1.2.0.x86_64-linux.iso.xz.sig
        gpg --verify guix-system-install-1.2.0.x86_64-linux.iso.xz.sig
      #+end_src
    - if then above command fails, then import the gpg public key first and then re-run the above verification:
      #+begin_src shell
        wget https://sv.gnu.org/people/viewgpg.php?user_id=15145 \
              -qO - | gpg --import -
      #+end_src
  - decompress the image with =xz -d= command to get =guix-system-install-1.2.0.x86_64-linux.iso= 
    #+begin_src shell
      xz -d guix-system-install-1.2.0.x86_64-linux.iso.xz
    #+end_src

**** Install in a fresh qemu virtual machine
Refer to [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#Installing-Guix-in-a-VM][Installing Guix in a Virtual Machine]]
  - install qemu following the instructions at [[https://www.qemu.org/download/][https://www.qemu.org/download/]]
  - create a fresh disk image in qcow2 format, where you can choose an
    appropriate size, e.g. 50G (the created image file will initially
    be much smaller, but will grow in size when it is filled up)
    #+begin_src shell
      qemu-img create -f qcow2 guix-system.img 50G
    #+end_src
  - boot the installation ISO image in the vm:
    #+begin_src shell
      qemu-system-x86_64 -m 1024 -smp 1 -enable-kvm \
        -nic user,model=virtio-net-pci -boot menu=on,order=d \
        -drive file=guix-system.img \
        -drive media=cdrom,file=guix-system-install-1.2.0.system.iso
    #+end_src
  - note that you may need to tweak the arguments to
    =qemu-system-x86_64= depending on your host system, e.g. you may
    need to replace =-enable-kvm= with =-accel hvf= in macOS. The
    =-enable-kvm= is optional anyway, but will significantly improve
    performance.
  - note the few things mentioned in https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#Preparing-for-Installation
    - The graphical installer is available on TTY1.
    - You can obtain root shells on TTYs 3 to 6 by hitting ctrl-alt-f3, ctrl-alt-f4, etc.
    - TTY2 shows this documentation and you can reach it with ctrl-alt-f2.
    - Documentation is browsable using the Info reader commands (see [[https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/info-stnd/info-stnd.html#Top][Stand-alone GNU Info]]).
    - The installation system runs the GPM mouse daemon, which allows you to select text with the left mouse button and to paste it with the middle button.
  - for simplicity, choose [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#Guided-Graphical-Installation][Guided Graphical Installation]] to finish the installation
  - after the installation, you can get into guix with the default
    xfce desktop whenever you invoke the vm
  - optional: since the command for invoking qemu can be very long,
    you may put it into a shell script to more conveniently invoke the
    vm
  - optional: you may use other front-ends (some are GUI) to more
    conveniently manage qemu vm, see
    https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Libvirt#Client

**** Install in other virtual machine
You can also install guix system using the ISO in other types of
virtual machines such as:
  - [[https://www.virtualbox.org/][VirtualBox]] (free)
  - [[https://www.parallels.com/][Parallels]] (proprietary)
  - [[https://www.vmware.com/][VmWare]] (proprietary)
  - and many others, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_platform_virtualization_software

Similar to installing in qemu vm:
  - note the few things mentioned in https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#Preparing-for-Installation
    - The graphical installer is available on TTY1.
    - You can obtain root shells on TTYs 3 to 6 by hitting ctrl-alt-f3, ctrl-alt-f4, etc.
    - TTY2 shows this documentation and you can reach it with ctrl-alt-f2.
    - Documentation is browsable using the Info reader commands (see [[https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/info-stnd/info-stnd.html#Top][Stand-alone GNU Info]]).
    - The installation system runs the GPM mouse daemon, which allows you to select text with the left mouse button and to paste it with the middle button.
  - for simplicity, choose [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#Guided-Graphical-Installation][Guided Graphical Installation]] to finish the installation
  - after the installation, you can get into guix with the default
    xfce desktop whenever you invoke the vm

**** Install on physical machine
Installing guix system on physical machine is similar to installing in
virtual machine, except that you need to transfer the ISO image to
either a USB stick or a DVD. It is recommended that you try to install
in a virtual machine first to get familiar with the process, see the
preceding subsection.

Refer to https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#USB-Stick-and-DVD-Installation
***** Copying to a USB Stick
  - Insert a USB stick of 1 GiB or more into your machine
  - if on a Linux machine, 
    - determine its device name, e.g. =/dev/sdb= or =/dev/sdc=. Note
      that it is VERY important to determine the correct device name,
      otherwise you may mistakenly wipe out another device.
    - assuming that the USB stick is known as =/dev/sdX=, copy the image
      with:
      #+begin_src shell
        # access to /dev/sdX usually requires root privilege
        # also, /dev/sdX should NOT be mount
        sudo dd if=guix-system-install-1.2.0.x86_64-linux.iso of=/dev/sdX status=progress
        sudo sync

***** Burning on a DVD
  - Insert a blank DVD into your machine
  - if on a Linux machine, 
    - determine its device name. Note that it is VERY important to
      determine the correct device name, otherwise you may mistakenly
      wipe out another device.
    - assuming that the DVD drive is known as =/dev/srX=, copy the image
      with:
      #+begin_src shell
        # access to /dev/srX usually requires root privilege
        growisofs -dvd-compat -Z /dev/srX=guix-system-install-1.2.0.x86_64-linux.iso

***** Installtion
Similar to installing in qemu vm:
  - note the few things mentioned in https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#Preparing-for-Installation
    - The graphical installer is available on TTY1.
    - You can obtain root shells on TTYs 3 to 6 by hitting ctrl-alt-f3, ctrl-alt-f4, etc.
    - TTY2 shows this documentation and you can reach it with ctrl-alt-f2.
    - Documentation is browsable using the Info reader commands (see [[https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/info-stnd/info-stnd.html#Top][Stand-alone GNU Info]]).
    - The installation system runs the GPM mouse daemon, which allows you to select text with the left mouse button and to paste it with the middle button.
  - for simplicity, choose [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#Guided-Graphical-Installation][Guided Graphical Installation]] to finish the installation
  - after the installation, you can get into guix with the default
    xfce desktop

*** Install the guix package manager in existing GNU/Linux distribution (possibly in a VM)
Besides installing guix system, you may also choose to only install
guix package manager on top of a GNU/Linux distribution (named
"foreign distro in guix documentation", which need not be a guix
system, e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, ArchLinux, etc).

Refer to [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#Binary-Installation][Binary Installation]]
  - the easiest way is to use the shell installer script:
    - download and execute the shell installer script as root
      #+begin_src shell
        cd /tmp
        wget https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/plain/etc/guix-install.sh
        chmod +x guix-install.sh
        ./guix-install.sh
      #+end_src
      - you may be asked to import gpg key, if so, just follow the instructions, then re-run the installer script
    - after that, check [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#Application-Setup][Application Setup]] for extra configuration you might need
  - alternatively, you may choose to install the guix package from the
    package manager of your distribution, if there is one, e.g.:
    - ArchLinux: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Guix#AUR_Package_Installation
    - Slackware: https://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.1/system/guix/
    - Fedora: https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/lantw44/guix/

** Brief summary of commonly used commands in Guix
Here we list some common commands and usage of Guix, see [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#Getting-Started][Getting Started]] of the Guix manual for more details.

*** Basic usage of Guix
**** Help on Guix command
     Help on the main usage, to see the available commands
     #+begin_src shell
       guix --help
     #+end_src

     Help on each command, e.g. the =guix package= command
     #+begin_src shell
       guix package --help
     #+end_src
**** Search package
     #+begin_src shell
       guix search keywords-here
       # guix package -s keywords-here
     #+end_src
**** Show information of package(s)
     #+begin_src shell
       guix show package1 package2
     #+end_src
**** Update channel(s)
     To update the channels so that all the package definitions are updated, but the packages themselves are not automatically updated.
     #+begin_src shell
       guix pull
     #+end_src
**** Install package(s)
     You can install one or more packages in one transaction
     #+begin_src shell
       guix install package1 package2
     #+end_src

     An alternative way
     #+begin_src shell
       guix package -i package1 package2
       # guix package --install package1 package2
     #+end_src
**** Remove package(s)
     #+begin_src shell
       guix remove package1 package2
     #+end_src

     An alternative way
     #+begin_src shell
       guix package -r package1 package2
       # guix package --remove package1 package2
     #+end_src
**** Upgrade package(s)
     #+begin_src shell
       guix upgrade package1 package2
     #+end_src

     An alternative way
     #+begin_src shell
       guix package -u package1 package2
       # guix package --upgrade package1 package2
     #+end_src     
**** Install/Remove/Upgrade package(s) in one transaction
     You can also install/remove/upgrade package(s) in a single transaction, simply list the package with suitable options of =guix package=, =-i= for installing, =-r= for removing, =-u= for upgrading:
     #+begin_src shell
       guix package -i package1 -r package2 -u package3
     #+end_src
**** List installed packages
     #+begin_src shell
       guix package -I
       # guix package --list-installed
     #+end_src
**** Rollback to the previous generation
     #+begin_src shell
       guix package --roll-back
     #+end_src
**** List generations
     #+begin_src shell
       guix package -l
       # guix package --list-generations
     #+end_src
**** Switch generations
     =PATTERN= can be a generation number or =+n= to go forward n generations; or =-n= to go backward n generations
     #+begin_src shell
       guix package -S PATTERN
       # guix package --switch-generation=PATTERN
     #+end_src

     E.g. to go forward one generation
     #+begin_src shell
       guix package -S +1
       # guix package --switch-generation=+1
     #+end_src

     E.g. to go backward one generation, similar to =--roll-back=, but if the specified generation does not exist, the current generation will not change
     #+begin_src shell
       guix package -S -1
       # guix package --switch-generation=-1
     #+end_src
     
*** Using manifest files to specify a list of packages
    A manifest file is a Scheme file that evaluates to a list of guix
    /packages/ (as Scheme object). A convenient way is to use the
    =specifications->manifest= function which takes a list of package
    names as strings and returns a list of the corresponding package
    objects. It can be used in a few contexts such as =guix package=
    to install packages, or =guix environment= to spawn a shell with
    specified packages (see below), through the =-m= or =--manifest=
    option. The advantage of a manifest file is that the list of
    packages can be easily version controlled (e.g. with =git=).

    An example of manifest file (let's say =pkgs.scm=) can be:
    #+begin_src scheme
      (specifications->manifest
       '(
         ;; R
         "r"
         "r-yaml"
         "r-xgboost"
         "r-tidymodels"
         "r-tidyverse"
         "r-survminer"
         ))
    #+end_src

**** Install the list of packages in a manifest file
     Note that the =-m= can be repeated multiple times with different
     manifest files, and the lists will be concatenated and all will
     be installed.

     #+begin_src shell
       guix package -m pkgs.scm
     #+end_src

     Note that a manifest file by itself only specifies the list of
     packages by name, but not the exact versions. In order to
     reproduce the exact versions of the list of packages, a manifest
     file can be combined with =guix time-machine= as described below.

*** Using Guix profiles
    Default guix actions (install/upgrade/remove) operates on the
    default /profile/ of each user (it is a symbolic link, default
    location is at =$HOME/.guix-profile=), but each user and create
    multiple profiles, activate the profiles as needed in similar ways
    to Python /virtual environments/, and specify the profile to
    operate on with each action through the =-p= (or =--profile=)
    option (see [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#Invoking-guix-package][Invoking guix package]]):

**** Create profile
     The profile name is basically symbolic link(s) to the real
     contents of the profile, and we can put it basically anywhere,
     e.g. =~/my-ds-profile=. So it is up to you to organize the
     profiles in a sensible way. It is also up to you to assign the
     roles of different profiles, e.g. one profile for each project;
     or different profiles for different domains of packages (e.g. one
     profile for data analysis, one profile for entertainment, one
     profile for graphics editing, etc).

     A profile will be created when you perform guix package actions
     specifying a profile, e.g. install =r= and =r-xgboost= in the
     profile =~/my-ds-profile=, which need not exist before this
     action:
     #+begin_src shell
       guix package -i r r-xgboost -p ~/my-ds-profile
     #+end_src

     Note that the created profile is not automatically activated, so
     you retain the maximum flexibility to activate as needed, or
     arrange to activate chosen profiles in each shell, see below.

**** Install or upgrade or remove packages in a profile
     Any usual =guix package= actions can be performed on a chosen
     profile by using the =-p= (or =--profile=) option, e.g. to
     install another package =r-yaml= to the profile =~/my-ds-profile=
     just created:
     #+begin_src shell
       guix package -i r-yaml -p ~/my-ds-profile
     #+end_src

     E.g. install packages using a manifest file in a profile:
     #+begin_src shell
       guix package -m the_manifest_file -p path_to_profile
     #+end_src
**** List profiles
     #+begin_src shell
       guix package --list-profiles
     #+end_src

**** Activate a profile
     Activating a profile amounts to modifying and exporting some
     environment variables (e.g. =PATH=) in the /current shell/, which
     is conveniently done by sourcing the =etc/profile= file under the
     profile. The recommended way to activate a profile,
     e.g. =~/my-ds-profile=, is to:
     #+begin_src shell
       GUIX_PROFILE="~/my-ds-profile" ; . "$GUIX_PROFILE"/etc/profile
     #+end_src

     Note that you can activate multiple profiles in the same shell as
     appropriate. But there is no effective way to /deactivate/ a
     profile in the same shell, other than exiting the shell. The
     upside is that the global environment is not "polluted", and you
     can start a new shell to activate a profile, then exit the shell
     afterwards.

     Also, you can automatically activate any profile in each spawn
     shell by adding the activation to your shell initialization,
     e.g. =.bash_profile= or =.bashrc=.
**** Delete a profile
     Somehow guix does not provide convenient command to delete a
     profile. Deleting a profile involves removing the profile
     symbolic link and its siblings that point to specific
     generations. E.g. to delete the =~/my-ds-profile= profile created
     above:
     #+begin_src shell
       rm ~/my-profile ~/my-profile-*-link
     #+end_src

**** Export current or chosen profile as a manifest file
     You can export the list of packages of a profile (if not specified, will use the default profile) to a manifest file. E.g. to export the default profile:
     #+begin_src shell
       guix package --export-manifest > pkgs1.scm
     #+end_src

     E.g. to export the above =~/my-ds-profile= profile:
     #+begin_src shell
       guix package --export-manifest -p ~/my-ds-profile > pkgs2.scm
     #+end_src

*** Using Guix environment
The =guix environment= command allows you to spawn a new shell with
certain packages (or their dependencies) accessible (by modifying some
environment variables, e.g. =PATH=), /without/ changing your other
profiles; and you can optionally either just spawn such a shell, or
execute a command inside this shell. Essentially a temporary profile
is created (for the set of packages wanted), so that you do not
"pollute" your other environment. The needed packages will be
automatically built if they are not yet in the cached store. So =guix
environment= is a very convenient way to reproduce a set of packages
in a clean way. For example, this can be used to manage per-project
dependencies, as we will see in the demo section.

Note that when in a shell spawn by =guix environment=, the environment
variable =GUIX_ENVIRONMENT= will have the value of the path to the
temporary profile for the environment, and you can detect it to change
the shell prompt, e.g. add this to your .bashrc:
#+begin_src shell
  if [ -n "$GUIX_ENVIRONMENT" ]
  then
    export PS1="\u@\h \w [dev]\$ "
  fi

#+end_src

**** Spawn a shell with dependencies of some packages
     E.g. to get the dependencies of =emacs= and =vim=:
     #+begin_src shell
       # guix environment pkg1 pkg2 ...
       guix environment emacs vim
     #+end_src

     Can also use =-m= (possibly multiple times) to specify manifest file(s):
     #+begin_src shell
       # guix environment pkg1 pkg2 ... -m pkgs1.scm -m pkgs2.scm ...
       guix environment kmahjongg -m pkgs.scm
     #+end_src

     Also check out =--load= option for loading a file for package.

**** Spawn a shell with some packages themselves
     E.g. to get game =kmahjongg= itself:
     #+begin_src shell
       # guix environment --ad-hoc pkg1 pkg2 ...
       guix environment --ad-hoc kmahjongg
     #+end_src

     Can also use =-m= (possibly multiple times) to specify manifest file(s):
     #+begin_src shell
       # guix environment --ad-hoc pkg1 pkg2 ... -m pkgs1.scm -m pkgs2.scm ...
       guix environment --ad-hoc kmahjongg -m pkgs.scm
     #+end_src

     Also check out =--load= option for loading a file for package.

**** Spawn a shell and directly execute some commands in it
     e.g. to get =R= and start it
     #+begin_src shell
       # guix environment --ad-hoc pkg1 ... -- pkg1
       guix environment --ad-hoc r -- R
     #+end_src

**** Spawn a shell where original environment variables are unset
     Use the =--pure= option, e.g. to get R
     #+begin_src shell
       # show all environment variables currently defined
       env
       # guix environment --pure --ad-hoc pkg1 ... -- pkg1
       guix environment --pure --ad-hoc r
       # then in the new shell, the PATH is reduced to only those for the
       # package, and even basic shell utilities are not in the PATH unless
       # they are added as one of the packages.
       echo $PATH
     #+end_src

     You may use the =--preserve= to control the environment variables
     to keep, check =guix environment --help= for more details.

**** Spawn a shell to run things in an isolated environment
     For further isolation, can use the =--container= option to run in
    a container where only the gnu store and (by default) the current
    directory are mounted. You may check =guix environment --help= for
    other relevant options, e.g. =--expose=, =--network=, =--share=,
    =--no-cwd=, =--user=.

     E.g. to run R in a container:
     #+begin_src shell
       # guix environment --ad-hoc pkg1 ... -- pkg1
       guix environment --container --ad-hoc r -- R
     #+end_src

     But seems this feature is not very mature yet. When I try the
     above command (on guix (GNU Guix)
     510e24f973a918391d8122fd6ad515c0567bf23e).  it gives this error:
     #+begin_src text
       guix environment: error: mount: mount "/home/peter" on "/tmp/guix-directory.QDXQmx//home/peter": Invalid argument
     #+end_src

*** Using Guix time-machine
    The =guix time-machine= can be used to execute other guix commands (e.g. =guix package=, or =guix environment=) at specified guix revisions (exact commits of the channels, which can be produced by =guix describe=)
**** Install package in a particular revision
     E.g. to install =emacs= at the revision in the file =channels.scm=
     #+begin_src shell
       guix time-machine -C channels.scm package -i emacs
     #+end_src

     The =channels.scm= could be obtained with =guix describe=, e.g.
     #+begin_src shell
       guix describe -f channels > channels.scm
     #+end_src

     The =channels.scm= will look something like (exact content of course depends on your channels)
     #+begin_src scheme
       (list (channel
               (name 'nonguix)
               (url "https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix")
               (commit
                 "05fad6e54d497b7427ab7ea488210c7d43c3f676")
               (introduction
                 (make-channel-introduction
                   "897c1a470da759236cc11798f4e0a5f7d4d59fbc"
                   (openpgp-fingerprint
                     "2A39 3FFF 68F4 EF7A 3D29  12AF 6F51 20A0 22FB B2D5"))))
             (channel
               (name 'guix)
               (url "https://git.sjtu.edu.cn/sjtug/guix.git")
               (commit
                 "8a452e156e37568fdd59df169acb4f2092aeb3ac")
               (introduction
                 (make-channel-introduction
                   "9edb3f66fd807b096b48283debdcddccfea34bad"
                   (openpgp-fingerprint
                     "BBB0 2DDF 2CEA F6A8 0D1D  E643 A2A0 6DF2 A33A 54FA")))))
     #+end_src
     Note that it is possible to hand-edit the file to the commit desired.

**** Use time-machine with guix environment
     Assuming there is a manifest file =pkgs.scm= containing the needed packages, e.g.
     #+begin_src scheme
       (specifications->manifest
        '(
          ;; R
          "r"
          "r-yaml"
          "r-xgboost"
          "r-tidymodels"
          "r-tidyverse"
          "r-survminer"
          ))
     #+end_src

     Then you can open a shell with these packages at the revisions specified in a =channels.scm=
     #+begin_src shell
       guix time-machine -C channels.scm -- environment --ad-hoc -m pkgs.scm
       # in this new shell where the packages are visible, you can run anything as needed
     #+end_src

     And you can directly run things in the new shell, e.g. to run R:
#+begin_src shell
       guix time-machine -C channels.scm -- environment --ad-hoc -m pkgs.scm -- R
     #+end_src

*** Use Guix to create docker image
    Guix can produce a docker image of a set of packages through =guix
pack= command, see [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Invoking-guix-pack.html#Invoking-guix-pack][Invoking guix pack]] and =guix pack --help= for more
description. In fact, =guix pack= can produce other formats, see =guix
pack --list-formats= for the possible formats.

**** Produce a docker image of a list of packages
     The set of packages can be specified as a list when calling =guix pack=.
     E.g. to get =R= and =xgboost=:
     #+begin_src shell
       # guix pack -f docker -S /bin=bin pkg1 pkg2 ...
       guix pack -f docker -S /bin=bin r r-xgboost
     #+end_src
     The =-S= option creates a symbolic link to file or directory
     under the profile (which is otherwise a path with long hash),
     provided for convenience. In the above example, a symbolic will
     be created at =/bin= pointing to the =bin= directory in the
     profile (which will be something like
     =/gnu/store/...-profile/bin=), then the user can start =R= with
     =/bin/R=.

     The path to the created tar.gz (something like
     =/gnu/store/...-docker-pack.tar.gz= with a long hash) file is
     output to stdout of the =guix pack= call, so we can get it like:
     #+begin_src shell
       PACKLOC=$(guix pack -f docker -S /bin=bin r r-xgboost)
       # then can easily copy it elsewhere
     #+end_src

     Then the file produced is a docker image that can be loaded into
     docker:
     #+begin_src shell
       # assume the file name is shortened docker-pack.tar.gz
       docker load < docker-pack.tar.gz
       # docker will show the image tag after loading
       # the tag of the image is generated from the set of packages
       docker run -ti r-r-xgboost /bin/R
     #+end_src

**** Produce a docker image of packages from a manifest file
     The set of packages can also be specified by a manifest file,
     similar to =guix package=, e.g. if we have a manifest file
     =pkgs.scm=:
     #+begin_src shell
       guix pack -f docker -S /bin=bin -m pkgs.scm
     #+end_src

     NOTE: the documentation specifically mention that the set of
     packages can be specified by either a list of package names as
     arguments to =guix pack=, or through a manifest file, but NOT
     BOTH. It is strange that there is such a limitation, hopefully it
     will be changed in the future.

**** Also specify an entry point command
     The =--entry-point= option can specify a command to run when the
     docker image is started, e.g. to run guile:
     #+begin_src shell
       # seems the command is relative to the profile path
       guix pack -f docker --entry-point=bin/guile guile
     #+end_src

     Then the produced image (say renamed to =pack.tar.gz=), can be
     loaded into docker and run as follows and =guile= will start
     automatically:
     #+begin_src shell
       docker load -i pack.tar.gz
       #docker run image-id
       # assume the image id is "guile"
       docker run guile
     #+end_src

**** Also use time-machine to pin package versions
     The =guix time-machine= can be used, together with a manifest
     file, to easily produce a docker image with the set of desired
     packages pinned to versions at a certain time point.

     E.g. suppose we have the channel file =channels.scm=, and
     manifest file =pkgs.scm=:
     #+begin_src shell
       guix time-machine -C channels.scm -- pack -f docker -S /bin=bin -m pkgs.scm
     #+end_src

     The above have been tested with =guix (GNU Guix)
     ff1c7e40252337cb2c992c2d41e0ed4cefe56df0= (installed on top of
     Debian 10 in a qemu VM), and the produced docker images have been
     tested on MacOS with Docker version 19.03.8, build afacb8b.

* A little demo of per-project dependency management

** Demo settings
Suppose we have two projects =~/guix_demo/proj1= and
=~/guix_demo/proj2=, each with different channel file =channels.scm=
and manifest file =pkgs.scm=, so the two projects uses different
versions of R (proj1 at R 3.6.3, proj2 at R 4.0.3) and different R
packages (at different versions).

Below we spawn two shells that allows us to work on the two projects
/at the same time/, and we show most of the output. If you try the
commands, you should get the same outputs, except possibly the locale
output from R which depends on your local setting.

*** Sample files
You may either manually create the following files, or clone the git
repository [[https://github.com/peterloleungyau/guix_demo][https://github.com/peterloleungyau/guix_demo]] created for
convenience (you should check that the files are the same as below).

If you are in guix but somehow do not have =git= installed yet, you
may either install it and then clone the repository by:
#+begin_src shell
  # install git, and also need ssh
  guix package -i git openssh
  # clone the repo
  cd ~
  git clone https://github.com/peterloleungyau/guix_demo.git
#+end_src

**** First project
=~/guix_demo/proj1/channels.scm=:
#+begin_src scheme
  (list (channel
         (name 'guix)
         (url "https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git")

     "r-xgboost"
     "r-jsonlite"
     ))
#+end_src

=~/guix_demo/proj1/fit1.R=
#+begin_src R
library(xgboost)

data(iris)

is_setosa <- as.numeric(iris$Species == "setosa")
iris_x <- as.matrix(iris[c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width",
                           "Petal.Length", "Petal.Width")])
iris_data <- xgb.DMatrix(data = iris_x, label = is_setosa)

param <- list(max_depth = 3, eta = 1, nthread = 1,
              objective = "binary:logistic", eval_metric = "auc")

print(fit)

#+end_src

**** Second project

#+begin_src scheme
  (list (channel
         (name 'guix)
         (url "https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git")
         (commit "9904a15a4c838362673c1affdbaf1e83d92fe8ff")))

                           "Petal.Length", "Petal.Width")])

fit <- glmnet(x = iris_x, y = is_setosa, family = "binomial")

summary(fit)
print(fit)

#+end_src

** Open a shell for the first project
First open a new shell with guix (could be the guix package manager on
a Linux distribution, or the guix system) to create an environment for
proj1:
#+begin_src shell
cd ~/guix_demo/proj1
guix time-machine -C channels.scm -- environment --ad-hoc -m pkgs.scm -- R
#+end_src

Then wait a while for the R prompt to appear. The first time executing
the above may take quite some time to download and/or build the
packages. Subsequent run should be much faster after the needed
packages are cached.

In the R REPL, we load the few packages and show their versions:

Then /while keeping the first shell open/ with the R prompt, we open a

#+begin_src shell

guix time-machine -C channels.scm -- environment --ad-hoc -m pkgs.scm -- R

** Close both shells
   Since we directly run =R= when creating the guix environment, so
   now quitting R with =q()= will also exit the spawn shell. So now we
   can exit both shells spawn above.

   If you now re-run the above commands, it should be much faster,
   because the needed packages are cached, and guix need only check
   that the packages needed are there.

** Run R script for the first project
We also run an R script:
#+begin_src shell
  cd ~/guix_demo/proj1
  guix time-machine -C channels.scm -- environment --ad-hoc -m pkgs.scm -- Rscript fit1.R
#+end_src
