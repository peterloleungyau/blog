This is the sixth part of a brief introduction to the Guix functional
package manager, and how it could be used to manage dependencies of
projects, much like virtual environments for Python, but with much
larger scope.

This time we explore some ways to use Guix for per-project dependency
management, for R development using Emacs, Jupyter lab, VSCode, and
Sublime Text 3. Here we demonstrate with Guix running inside qemu VM
in MacOS. This setup should work for either local development with
Linux host running Guix package manager, or when connecting to a
remote server running Guix package manager. Although we focus on R
development for data science projects, similar setup should also work
for Python or other languages.

# summary

* Basic Idea
In previous posts (e.g. [[./guix_intro_5_per_proj_dep.org][Guix Introduction Part 5: Per-Project
Dependency Management]]), we introduced =guix environment= together with
=guix time-machine= to use a manifest file (=pkgs.scm=) for packages
and a channel file (=channels.scm=) for exact package versions, to
create a shell with per-project dependencies. It is intuitive that if
we somehow spawn a shell with the needed R version and other
dependencies, and point the development tool (IDE or text editors) to
the proper R, then things should work as usual.

Depending on the way that the development tool connects to R, there
are two ways that this can work interactively and one way for batch
jobs:

1. Interactive: First spawn a shell with needed dependencies, then start the tool

   - Some development tools (by default) simply look up the R
     executable or R kernel from =PATH=, e.g. Emacs, Vim or Neovim, RStudio
     desktop version, Jupyter lab etc. Therefore one way is to first spawn the
     shell using =guix time-machine= and =guix environment= (or the
     prepared alias or helper script, as we show below), then start
     the tool inside this shell.
   - The downside is that you would need to restart your development
     tool if the dependencies is changed in the middle of development,
     e.g. while your are writing some code, then realize that you need
     to use another R package not listed in the manifest file, then
     you would need to:

     + exit the development tool and the spawn shell
     + edit the manifest file =pkgs.scm= to add the R package
     + respawn the shell
     + restart the development tool

2. Interactive: First start the development tool, then start R through a wrapper
   script to first spawn the shell with needed dependencies, possibly
   manually in a terminal.

   - Some tools such as VSCode or Sublime Text have plugins that can start a
     terminal, and send code from the editor to the terminal
     through hotkey. Therefore, we can start a terminal from within
     the tool, then spawn a shell with needed dependencies within the
     terminal and start R, and after that we should be able to code as
     usual, but with the needed dependencies.
   - In tools such as VSCode and Sublime Text, this is easier than
     pointing the R executable to be calling a wrapper script that
     starts R inside a =guix environment=.
   - However, in Emacs, we could just as easily point the R
     executable to a wrapper script to start R inside a =guix
     environment=, and then can operate just as usual.
   - The downside (not applicable to the Emacs case) of starting R in
     the terminal is that there is less integration with the editor in
     terms of auto-completion. E.g. if you create some variables in the
     R session, then back in the editor, the newly created variable is
     not available for completion. For better integration, we may need
     to use LSP (=languageserver= package in R), but so far I have not
     completely figured it out yet.
3. Batch job: The way for batch job is to simply run R script inside the spawn
   Guix environment using =guix environment= and =guix time-machine=.

   - The downside is that this is not interactive development, which
     is very different from the usual R practice of using
     REPL. Therefore this is more suitable for running always tested R
     scripts.

* Setup Guix
For completeness, we describe the setup of the Guix package manager
on a foreign distribution, in particular, on Debian in a VM. The same
should work on Guix system (i.e. the Guix Linux distribution).

** Install Debian VM
  1. Download Debian 10 from [[https://www.debian.org/]]
  2. Follow [[./guix_intro_4_try.org][Guix Introduction Part 4: Try Guix]] to use the
     debian-10.8.0-amd64-netinst.iso to install on a 50G qcow2 disk
     using qemu, but you can also choose to install Debian using other
     virtual machine (such as virtualbox), or install on physical
     machine. E.g. we create an image file =debian-10.8.0-guix.img=,
     using the qcow2 format with a capacity of 50G by:
     #+begin_src shell
     qemu-img create -f qcow2 debian-10.8.0-guix.img 50G
     #+end_src
     Then start qemu and proceed with normal Debian installation.
  3. Here we use the user name =guest= for the VM, you may choose your
     own user name, but make sure you change the subsequent commands
     accordingly.
  4. It suffices to have a minimal install without desktop environment,
     but with ssh server. You may optionally choose to install a
     desktop environment.
  5. Install ssh server and =git=, also add the user to sudoer:
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
       apt-get update
       apt-get install git
       apt-get sudo
       # add to sudoer
       usermod -a -G sudo guest
       # ssh server
       apt-get install openssh-server
       sudo systemctl enable ssh
     #+END_SRC
  6. Config ssh
     - Reference: https://devconnected.com/how-to-install-and-enable-ssh-server-on-debian-10/
     - Add =PermitRootLogin no= to =/etc/ssh/sshd_config=
     - Forward port 10022 (you can choose a different port, and adjust
       the following accordingly) to 22 in qemu by adding =-net
       user,hostfwd=tcp::10022-:22= to the qemu invocation command, e.g.
       #+begin_src shell
         qemu-system-x86_64 \
            -nic user,model=virtio-net-pci \
            -enable-kvm -m 1024 \
            -net user,hostfwd=tcp::10022-:22 \
            -device virtio-blk,drive=myhd \
            -drive if=none,file=./debian-10.8.0-guix.img,id=myhd
       #+end_src
     - Generate ssh key to conveniently login to the VM
       - Reference: https://devconnected.com/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-on-debian-10-buster/
       - In the VM
         #+BEGIN_SRC shell
           # generate ssh key, save to id_vm_rsa
           ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "guest@debianguix.org"
         #+END_SRC
       - In the host, follow the above reference to copy the ssh key to the host
     - Add to =~/.ssh/config= in the host for convenience, so that we can ssh into the VM with just =ssh vm=
       - Reference https://www.xmodulo.com/how-to-speed-up-x11-forwarding-in-ssh.html?format=pdf
       - Add to =~/.ssh/config= (adjust the =Port= to be the same as
         the forward port in qemu, and the =User= to be your chosen
         user name):
       #+BEGIN_SRC text
         Host vm
           HostName localhost
           Port 10022
           AddKeysToAgent yes
           UseKeychain yes
           User guest
           ForwardX11 yes
           Compression yes
           # Ciphers blowfish-cbc,arcfour # your ssh client may not support the particular cipher, check with "ssh -Q cipher"
           ConnectTimeout 20
           StrictHostKeyChecking no
           UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
           IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
       #+END_SRC
  7. This should finish the setup of a Debian 10 VM with ssh, test
     that you can ssh into the VM without typing password by:
     #+begin_src shell
     ssh vm
     #+end_src

** Install Guix package manager
   We use the installation script to install Guix package manager:
  - Reference: https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#Binary-Installation
  - Steps:
    1. Run as root:
       #+BEGIN_SRC shell
         apt-get install gpg
         cd /tmp
         wget https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/plain/etc/guix-install.sh
         chmod +x guix-install.sh
         ./guix-install.sh
         # import the gpg key as instructed, then run the script again
       #+END_SRC
    2. Change Debian locale to =en_US.utf8=, but select "None" as the default
       - Follow instructions in https://wiki.debian.org/Locale
    3. Install Guix locale as user
       #+BEGIN_SRC shell
         guix install glibc-locales
       #+END_SRC
    4. (Optional) Add to =~/.bashrc= for a different prompt when in a Guix environment:
       #+BEGIN_SRC shell
         if [ -n "$GUIX_ENVIRONMENT" ]
         then
             export PS1="\u@\h \w [dev]\$ "
         fi

       #+END_SRC
    5. Add to =~/.profile= (or =~/.bash_profile=)
       #+BEGIN_SRC shell
         export GUIX_LOCPATH=$HOME/.guix-profile/lib/locale
         GUIX_PROFILE="/home/guest/.guix-profile"
         . "$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile"

       #+END_SRC

* Setup for different tools
** Common things for convenience
*** Script to start environment
A convenient way to start the =guix environment= using =guix time-machine= is useful.
     - the simplest way:
       - add a shell alias, assuming we always place the channels file
         =channels.scm= and manifest file =pkgs.scm= at project root,
         we may use an alias such as:
         #+begin_src shell
           alias work="guix time-machine -C channels.scm -- environment --ad-hoc -m pkgs.scm"
         #+end_src
       - this method is simple but assumes the locations of the channels and manifest file.
     - a more flexible way:
       - prepare a command (call it =work=) in the VM as an executable shell script
         - purpose:
           - find =channels.scm= and =pkgs.scm= from the current directory up to root
           - spawn Guix environment
           - the command also allows extra arguments to be passed, e.g. to execute vim
         - put at =/usr/local/bin/work= the following file
           #+BEGIN_SRC shell
             #!/bin/bash

             # adapted from https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/22215
             findup () {
                 if [ -e "./$1" ]
                 then
                     echo "."
                 else
                     path=$(pwd)
                     while [[ "$path" != "" && ! -e "$path/$1" ]]; do
                         path=${path%/*}
                     done
                     echo "$path"
                 fi
             }

             cfpath=$(findup channels.scm)
             pfpath=$(findup pkgs.scm)

             # https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/415028
             channel_file=${cfpath:+${cfpath}/}channels.scm
             pkgs_file=${pfpath:+${pfpath}/}pkgs.scm

             exec guix time-machine -C "${channel_file}" -- environment --ad-hoc -m "${pkgs_file}" "$@"

           #+END_SRC
         - make it executable:
           #+begin_src shell
             chmod +x /usr/local/bin/work
           #+end_src
       - advantage: can easily allow different manifest files or
         channels files at different subdirectores, should that be
         needed.
*** Script to start R (optional)
     - optionally prepare a command (call it =rwork=) in the VM to call R in the spawn environment
       - useful for starting R in =ESS= within =emacs=
       - put at =/usr/local/bin/rwork=, and make it executable
         #+BEGIN_SRC shell
           #!/bin/bash

           # add r-dt for DT to be loadable
           exec work r-dt -- R --no-save "$@"

         #+END_SRC
*** Script to start radian (optional)
Some may prefer [[https://github.com/randy3k/radian][radian]] to plain R console, especially when explicitly starting R in terminal, e.g. for use in Sublime Text and VSCode.
     - prepare radian in VM
       - tried but encountered problems in Debian 10 VM:
         - tried installing =radian= from pypi, but encountered glibc version mismatch when in different Guix environment
         - so also tried installing radian in guix, but seems still may have glibc version mismatch unless we build the radian together with the environment
       - one tried method that works: add =radian= to Guix and add it to the package list in the =guix environment=:
         - =radian= is not currently (at the time of writing) in the official Guix repository, so we import it with =guix import pypi -r radian= to get a skeleton, but need some fiddling to get it to build:
           - need to add importing of gnu modules at the top
           - need to disable the tests in the few packages including =radian=, =rchitect=, =lineedit= to build without error
           - need to fix some inputs, especially =python-pytest-runner=
           - need to use newer version of =python-pyte= (at least 0.8.0), so included a modified definition of =python-pyte=
         - the resulting file: to be put in the VM as =~/extra/radian.scm=

*** X forwarding settings (optional)
X forwarding may come into handy for viewing plots, or viewing data frames through R =DT=.
       - on Mac host, install XQuartz
         - refer to https://www.xquartz.org/
       - add =xhost + 127.0.0.1= to the qemu starting script, before starting the VM
       - use X forwarding in ssh
         - either use =ssh +XC vm= to connect, or
         - add =ForwardX11 yes= to =~/.ssh/config= as shown above
       - (optional) for R =DT= to work inside VM, do these *inside the VM*
         - install a web browser:
           - e.g. Firefox
             #+BEGIN_SRC shell
             sudo apt-get install firefox-esr
             #+END_SRC
           - or you may choose a more light-weight browser such as
             [[https://astian.org/en/midori-browser/][midori]], which can and should be installed through Guix (to
             avoid dynamic library problem in different Guix
             environment):
             #+BEGIN_SRC shell
             guix package -i midori
             #+END_SRC
         - DT needs the "browser" option to point to a browser,
           e.g. firefox. You may add the following to =~/.Rprofile=,
           create the file =~/.Rprofile= if it does not exist:
           #+BEGIN_SRC R
             # for DT::datatable to work, you may use other browser you like, if it is installed in the system
             options(browser = "midori") # alternative
             # options(browser = "firefox") # alternative

             # (optional) can consider overriding View as DT::datatable for convenience, as the default View is not very good in X forwarding
             if(requireNamespace("DT", quietly = T)) {View <- DT::datatable}
           #+END_SRC
** Jupyter lab
*** Idea
       - to install Jupyter lab in the VM, to use with R kernel
       - then use =work= to get the Guix environment we want, to start
         Jupyter
       - then connect from browser with port forwarding, then we have
         nice graphics, just as with any Jupyter notebook
*** Setup
       - *side note*: one way is to use =guix-jupyter=
         - reference: https://hpc.guix.info/blog/2019/10/towards-reproducible-jupyter-notebooks/
         - it allows specifying Guix environment within the notebook
           itself
         - so can pin the versions of the needed packages
         - but this will then be different from using other approaches
           here
         - so this method is for reference, and left for the reader to
           explore
       - for consistency, the Jupyter and R kernels should be
         installed in the same Guix environment along with other
         project packages
         - basically we need
           - =jupyter=
           - =r-irkernel= for the R kernel
           - =r-irdisplay= for rich display capabilities
           - Optionally, =python-ipykernel= for python kernel
         - so prepare an executable shell script at
           =/usr/local/bin/jrwork= with the following:
           #+BEGIN_SRC shell
             #!/bin/bash

             # add those for jupyter
             exec work jupyter r-irkernel r-irdisplay -- jupyter notebook "$@"

           #+END_SRC
*** Usage
       1. start the VM
       2. ssh into the VM, e.g. with the above convenient setup
          #+begin_src shell
            ssh vm
          #+end_src
       3. go to the project directory
       4. start jupyter with dependencies using =jrwork=

          #+CAPTION: Start Jupyter in Guix environment
          [[file:guix_intro_6_jupyter_1_jrwork.png]]

       5. once jupyter is started, note the port number of the url,
          which may be different in different invocations e.g. if the
          link is
          "http://localhost:8888/?token=05d71e9d8a6a687be01e307aba974f88b4834cf9f7ca1ba9
          the port *inside VM* is 8888
       6. do ssh port forwarding
          - reference: https://www.ssh.com/ssh/tunneling/example
          - the easiest way is to map the same port number in your
            local machine to the port number inside VM, but you may
            choose a different port number (don't choose a too small
            number, or it may be restricted by your OS)
          - in another terminal in you local machine, ssh with port
            forwarding
          - the general syntax of ssh port forwarding into the VM is
            =ssh -L xxx:localhost:yyy vm=, where =xxx= is the local
            port number you like, and =yyy= is the port number inside
            the VM, so for the above example of port 8888 and map to
            the same port, we would type /in a new terminal/ and leave
            it open while working in Jupyter:
            #+begin_src shell
              ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 vm
            #+end_src

            #+CAPTION: Port forwarding in ssh
            [[file:guix_intro_6_jupyter_2_port_forwarding.png]]

       7. browse the url for Jupyter
          - in your local browser, paste the link printed by Jupyter
            in the VM, but remember to change the port number to be
            your chosen local port number (if you choose a different
            port number)

            #+CAPTION: Browse URL of Jupyter
            [[file:guix_intro_6_jupyter_3_browser_connect.png]]

       8. then start using Jupyter
          #+CAPTION: Open Jupyter
          [[file:guix_intro_6_jupyter_4_open_jupyter.png]]

          #+CAPTION: Open notebook and work
          [[file:guix_intro_6_jupyter_5_open_notebook.png]]

       9. when done
          - in the browser, press quit and logout
          - close connection of the ssh for port forwarding
          - exit the shell of Guix environment by pressing Ctrl+c
          - close the original connection to the VM and exit if appropriate
** VSCode
*** Idea
       - can use [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh][Remote-SSH]] plugin
         - which essentially will install a VSCode in the VM
         - then allows us to use VSCode as if it is local
       - then configure the remote one for R programming
         - change the R executable name to be =rwork= to use the
           proper dependencies using Guix
*** Setup
       1. prepare for R =languageserver= needed for VSCode's R LSP Client extension
          - at the time of writing, R =languageserver= is not in Guix's
            official repository, so we import it from CRAN
            #+BEGIN_SRC shell
              guix import cran -r languageserver > r_languageserver.scm
            #+END_SRC
          - then need to add something at the top to use modules
            needed, and at the bottom to return the =r-languageserver=
            package, to get a file that can be used in =guix
            environment= to get =languageserver=, together with other
            project packages
            - the modified file is put in the VM at =~/extra/r_languagerserver.scm=:
              #+BEGIN_SRC scheme

          - click "Open Folder" in Explorer
          - find the project folder and click "Ok"

            #+CAPTION: Open project folder
            [[file:guix_intro_6_vscode_5_open_folder.png]]
       4. open R in terminal
          - if terminal is not ok yet, open one with menu "Terminal"
            -> "New Terminal"
          - in the terminal (which should already be in the project
            directory), type =rcwork= (for plain R) or =rcdwork= (for
            =radian=)
          - then wait until R prompt appears

            [[file:guix_intro_6_vscode_6_rcwork.png]]
       5. then can open any R file that you want to edit, and send
          code (default key Command+Enter in Mac) to the terminal as
          needed

** Sublime Text 3
*** Idea
       - use sftp extension for editing files in the VM
       - open terminal into the vm
       - in the ssh session, get to desired directory
       - call the command and open R or radian in Guix environment
       - use SendCode extension to send part of source file to the
         terminal (where R is started) to evaluate
*** Setup
       - install [[https://www.sublimetext.com/3][Sublime Text 3]]
       - install sftp plugin
         - references:
           - https://morannachum.wordpress.com/2015/04/05/how-to-configure-a-sftp-folder-in-sublime/
           - https://notepadhelper.com/sublime-text/ftp-connection-sftp-plugin/
         - first install "Package Control" under "Tools"

             #+CAPTION: Package Control in Sublime Text 3
             [[file:guix_intro_6_sublime_text3_1_package_control.png]]

         - then under "Sublime Text" -> "Preferences" -> "Package Control", choose "Install package"
         - then type "SFTP", then it will install
         - setup ssh into the server
           - reference: https://codexns.io/products/sftp_for_sublime/usage
           - under "Sublime Text" -> "Preferences" -> "Package Settings" -> "SFTP" -> "Settings"
           - under "File" -> "SFTP/FTP" -> "Setup Server"
             - change the "host", "user", "port", "remote_path", "ssh_key_file" to match the ssh settings

       2. open terminal /inside Sublime Text/, e.g. by using Ctrl+Alt+t configured above, then ssh into VM by =ssh vm=
          #+CAPTION: Ssh into VM in Sublime Text 3
          [[file:guix_intro_6_sublime_text3_3_ssh_vm.png]]
       3. go to the desired project directory, run =rwork= (for plain R) or =rdwork= (for radian)

** Emacs
*** Idea
       - use [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode][Tramp mode]], which can ssh into the VM transparently
       - prepare a command (=rwork= prepared above) in the VM (an executable shell script) to
         - find =channels.scm= and =pkgs.scm= from the current directory up to root
         - spawn Guix environment
         - execute R, so that we are using the intended environment
       - in emacs, change =inferior-R-program-name= in [[https://ess.r-project.org/][ESS]] to call the prepared command
       - then should be able to use R in emacs as usual using ESS
*** Setup
       - customize tramp for convenience, add to =.emacs= in host,
         assuming you alreay use [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/UsePackage][use-package]]:
         #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
           ;; For Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) to run R
           (use-package ess
             :ensure t
             :init (require 'ess-site)
             (setq ess-fancy-comments nil))

           ;; For connecting in tramp mode to vm
           (use-package tramp
             :ensure nil
             :custom
             (tramp-default-method "sshx")
             (tramp-default-user "guest")
             (tramp-default-host "vm"))

           (setq inferior-R-program-name "rwork")
         #+END_SRC
*** Usage
       1. use tramp to ssh into the desired directory, e.g. =C-x C-f /sshx:vm:guix_demo=
          #+CAPTION: Ssh to remote using tramp in Emacs
          [[file:guix_intro_6_emacs_1_tramp.png]]
       2. then navigate to project directory if needed
          #+CAPTION: Navigate to project directory using dired in Emacs
          [[file:guix_intro_6_emacs_2_to_project.png]]
       3. start R with =M-x R=
          #+CAPTION: Start R in Guix environment with ESS in Emacs
          [[file:guix_intro_6_emacs_3_start_r.png]]
       4. use R in emacs through ESS as usual
          - =C-c C-c= to evaluate block of code
          - =C-c C-r= to evaluate selected region of code
          - =C-c C-z= to switch back and forth between code buffer and R REPL buffer

            #+CAPTION: Run R code in ESS in Emacs
            [[file:guix_intro_6_emacs_4_run_code.png]]
       5. when done, just quit R as usual, e.g. using =q()= in the R prompt
          #+CAPTION: Quit R in Emacs
          [[file:guix_intro_6_emacs_5_quit_r.png]]

* Un-explored tools
I originally intended to also include RStudio and Vim or Neovim, but
did not figure out the details. Nevertheless, I will briefly describe
the idea to make them work with Guix for per-project dependency
management, for interested readers to explore.

** RStudio Desktop
[[https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/][RStudio desktop]] is commonly used for R development. Since it by
default looks for R in =PATH=, so starting RStudio desktop in a Guix
environment should just work in getting the needed project
dependencies, although I have not tried it.

    - idea:
      - start Guix environment using =work=
      - then start RStudio desktop
      - work as usual

** RStudio Server
[[https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/][RStudio server]] is an alternative to RStudio desktop version. While
the commercial version has a lot of useful features for use in a
team, the open source version is much more limited. RStudio server is
intended to be run in a shared server allowing access from multiple
users, but the open source version does not allow easily switching
between different R versions and dependencies. Also, RStudio server
has its own wrapper of starting an R session, so it is not
straight-forward to use it with Guix for per-project dependency
management. Nevertheless, someone has configured it to use [[https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/][conda]] to
manage per-project dependencies, see
https://github.com/grst/rstudio-server-conda . Using the same idea
should allow using Guix for per-project dependencies instead, but I am
only half-way through the configuration, and not finished yet.

     - idea:
       - use the same idea as in https://github.com/grst/rstudio-server-conda
       - the idea is to start RStudio server in non-daemon mode, and
         does not start it as a service
       - then spawn a Guix environment shell with needed dependencies,
         then start RStudio server
       - then can connect in the browser, if we setup port forwarding
         properly
** Vim or Neovim
Since I do not use R inside Vim, I do not bother getting it to work
with Guix, but it should be pretty similar to the Sublime Text or
VSCode setup.

     - idea:
       - the Vim or Neovim and related plugins can be installed either in the
         base Debian, or installed through Guix to the default profile
       - ssh into the VM, then get to desired directory, then start Vim or Neovim
       - inside (Neo)Vim, use the usual workflow, e.g. open a terminal
       - inside that terminal, start =rwork= for plain R or =rdwork=
         for =radian=.
       - edit and send code to the terminal for evaluation
       - when done, just exit the terminal and quit (Neo)Vim.
     - reference:
       - My colleague Alfred Sam is enthusiastic in using Vim and
         Neovim for R, Python and Julia development. Interested
         readers may refer to his two blog posts:
         - [[https://alfredfaisam.medium.com/neovim-setups-for-data-science-5ea251e3735f][Neovim Setups for Data Science]]
         - [[https://medium.com/geekculture/environment-setups-for-data-scientists-under-garuda-linux-ed6492a2a1ab][Environment Setups for Data Scientists under Garuda Linux]]

* What's next?
  In this part we showed ways of using Guix for per-project
  dependency for R development, using Emacs, Jupyter lab, VSCode and
  Sublime Text 3, we also discussed ideas of using Guix with RStudio,
  Vim and Neovim. This concludes the introduction to Guix, although we
  still have not covered quite a lot topics. In future posts, we will
  pick some interesting topics to explore.
