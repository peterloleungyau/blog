Hello, I am Peter Lo. I received my B.Sc. in [Risk Management Science](http://www2.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/rms/), and my Ph.D. in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/en/), both from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html). During my Ph.D. study, I worked in Bioinformatics, focusing on inferring gene regulatory network from gene expression data. After graduation, I worked as a Postdoc at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, where I worked on Chinese NLP.

I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, including Symbolic AI, Machine Learning and Natural Computing techniques. I also enjoy music at my leisure.

Now I work as a data scientist in the Hong Kong data science team of [MassMutual](https://www.massmutual.com/about-us), which is an insurance company based in the U.S. with a long history.
